# Work with me in person

I believe that you, your body, your soul - your own existence has all the answers to what you have been questioning in your life, and my job is to access them. You have the choice and power to create the life you love. I focus on your psyche, your body and your imagination (visualizations), to help you understand what's going on with your life, and what would you rather prefer. I don't have a coaching certificate, neither I call myself a coach, I just want to help you live the life you love.

Yes, blame the society, situation, education system, parents, or politics. But,

> "The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine." 
-- Nikola Tesla

## The process

### 1. I ask you questions.

- Questions are doorways to new openings and direction(s) in life.
- Sometimes the answer to a question is not in a statement, but in another, bigger question.
- "No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it." - Albert Einstein.
- So basically, when we reach to a certain level of understanding about yourself, through questioning, a lot of the problems disappear.
- After that, a new direction opens up, which of course brings bigger questions, but also an exciting life.

### 2. I give you massages, exercises, and nutritional suggestions.

- We spend a lot of time changing our experiences and outer situations, completely forgetting that all our experiences, good or bad, are experienced through the body.
- Your moods (thus your reactions to situations, and thus your experiences in life) highly depend on the hormones and nutritions in your body. You literally create a good life with a good body.
- The cells become used to the kind of hormones (or chemicals) that are generated along with the food or the experience of a situation. That's how we form habits. Massages and exercises are very good ways to access the accumulated shit, release it, and create room for new habits and memories.
- Your body is made literally made of what you eat.
- When you start treating your body well, and make decisions accordingly in your life, you automatically create exciting experiences. For eg. if you join the rock climbing gym, you might end up on a road trip in the mountains with fellow climbers. Or, you might meet your lover at the yoga class, experiencing much better intimacy with someone who is conscious about their body. Disclaimer: This is just an example, do not take yoga places as fast-dating venues.

### 3. I help you dream, and visualize.

- Every creation, is first created in the mind. Art, technological innovation, or the life you love, the first steps to create them is to visualize them.
- When you visualize, and you really feel it in your bones, you are already creating the memories and habits throughout your body, which will help you manifest the dream.
- But yes, all our dreams are not meant to come true, simply because there are better ones waiting. So rather than blindly following these dreams, we question them, take insights and get down to what is the true desire, wHich opens more doors and possibilities in life.
- This is very different from mere day-dreaming, as we are not disconnecting from the reality, living in the fantasies. Here we are really considering the possibilities of life.

### 4. I help you find the ways to contribute to the planet - the nature and the society.

- We all love nature so much. But let's face it, we have been raping her in the asshole for a very long time. Nature doesn't need love or support from us, but at least she needs a proof that we are worthy of being supported by her. We are on the verge of a planetary crisis, and we are the only one to blame. The planet and the nature will survive, but we may not.
- Except a few assholes, deep within us we are all wired to love our fellow habitants - people, animals or vegetation. If we are really living the live we love, let's share some love with others.
- I help you formulate your ideas, or give you new ones, to create a sustainable income out of helping others, or creating planet-conscious products.

### 5. Help somebody live the life they love

- Now it's your turn. Help somebody that you know, who might be struggling or just discovering the life they love. Pass on the values and lessons.
