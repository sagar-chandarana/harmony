## Workshops

Inspiration is contagious. In a workshop I bring together the people who are discovering the life they love, and let them talk about the life they dream of. And then, there’s a fountain of inspirations and good energies flowing from each person, inspiring everybody else even more. Conversations about dreams, coupled with some physical exercises and games, a workshop is 3 hours of ultimate fun. People also share the dark side of their lives, and everybody in the room empathizes and heals the wounds. 
 
At the end of the workshop you go home, connected more with your authentic self, confident and believing that living the life you love is truly possible. 
 
Here’s a video from the previous workshop that I did in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
